                    <h3>1. Accommodation </h3>
                    <br />
                  
                    <p>Drawing tourists from all over the world, you’ll be spoilt for choice when booking hotels in Cyprus. Limassol is the business centre of the island, home to a busy commercial port surrounded by resorts, making it a prime spot for MICE-ready hotels. You’ll find an array of five- and four-star options, from large conference hotels to boutique properties for smaller incentives. Expect names like the Crowne Plaza, Four Seasons and Parklane, a Luxury Collection Resort & Spa, Limassol to name a few.<br/><br/>

                    And which Limassol hotel is soon to become Europe’s first-ever integrated resort? Well, that would be our host hotel, The City of Dreams Mediterranean, of course. A premium hotel featuring 500 luxury rooms, a casino, and a resort housing Cyprus’s largest pool complex, it’s a unique venue that’s offering up something completely different for Limassol. Oh, and did we mention, you’ll be among the first to experience it.

                    <h3>2. Location  </h3>
                    <br />
                  
                    <p>Conveniently located in the eastern Mediterranean, between Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa, our partner CIMA (Cyprus Incentives & Meetings Associates) describes Cyprus as ‘a natural meeting place for centuries’. There are two international airports in Cyprus, Larnaca and Paphos International Airport; Limassol conveniently sits equidistant from both. With only a 3-hour drive to get you from one end of the island to the other, travelling around Cyprus is a breeze. Not to mention its 300 days of sunshine every year – it's a buyer's dream!  </p>

                    <h3>3. Meetings and events </h3>
                    <br />
                  
                    <p>When our host hotel, The City of Dreams Mediterranean, launches it will house over 8,000m² of indoor and outdoor event space – the most of any hotel in the area. It boasts a ballroom, a forum, five meeting rooms and outdoor space. Other options include high-end resorts like Parklane, a Luxury Collection Resort-Spa, with meeting rooms and conference space included. In the last year Limassol hosted The INC 2022 (Tourism, Hospitality & Events International Conference) and in 2023 it plays host to the Congress of the European Orthodontic Society and Reflect Festival, celebrating tech and business.  <br/><br/>

More widely, Cyprus as an island offers variety and uniqueness when it comes to meeting and event spaces. From medieval castle courtyards to ancient amphitheatres, planners will be spoilt for choice!</p>

                    <h3>4. Food and drink </h3>
                    <br />
<p>Halloumi, olives, feta – we could go on. Cyprus is famous for its quality Mediterranean cuisine. Perfect for warm weather and for sharing in large groups (meze, anyone?), the Mediterranean diet is known around the world for its health benefits. There's something for everyone – why not indulge in a souvlakia, a grilled meat kebab, or tuck into a hearty vegetarian dish of Fasolada, a white bean and vegetable stew. Whether you’re looking for traditional dishes or just a good old burger and chips, Limassol can cater to all tastes and price ranges.  </p><br/><br/>

<h3>5. Culture</h3>
                    <br />
                  
                    <p>With numerous museums and archaeological sites around the city illustrating its Frankish, Byzantine and Ottoman history, it’s impossible to leave Limassol without an understanding of its fascinating past. The city is also home to the largest collection of Cypriot modern art, housed at the Municipal Art Gallery and costs only €2,00 per person to visit. And from September until February visitors can witness its various annual folklore festivals, showcasing numerous companies performing traditional folklore dances.
