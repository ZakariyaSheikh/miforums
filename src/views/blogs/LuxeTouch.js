                    <p>As m&i Luxe, Porto Montenegro 2023 inches ever closer, we felt it was about time you got to know one of our Luxe buyers, and our host hotel, a little better. If you didn't know, m&i Luxe, is our new event designed specifically for high-end incentives and MICE VIP events, and on the 11-14 October, we'll be taking our new venture to Montenegro's most luxrious port. Discover more about our event <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mi-forums.com/mi-luxe-porto-montenegro-2023">here</a> or keep reading to get a taste of the Luxe guestlist </p>
    <br/><br/>

                    <h3>Meet high-end buyers </h3>

    <br></br>
                    <p>Luxe is a select and intimate experience for suppliers with exquisite properties and buyers looking to book high-end board meetings, VIP MICE events and high-end incentive travel. One of only a handful of industry events like it, it’s an exclusive space in the MICE sphere requiring an exclusive guestlist.  </p>

                    <div className="pullquote"> <quote><span></span>Nicola Colligan, Ashfield Event Experiences<span></span> </quote>

                    </div>
                    

    <br></br>                
                    <p>We spoke with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?trk=bf&trkInfo=AQFX6ySkRCbVQAAAAYr_brUA9A75D25rBkqCF5lt8x9pFDkZKMheuhyVXNwsSyBnbkPLfrcm5JrmDdZmTVi7xdxXv6e12VNCcZtaKVl_jS7LUPBjU-U8LGCvOhcLKhPsoENut1Y=&original_referer=&sessionRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fnicola-colligan-28335624%2F">Nicola Colligan</a>, an Account Manager at Ashfield Event Experiences and a confirmed buyer attending m&i Luxe, Porto Montenegro 2023. Over 16 years’ experience in the industry, currently specialising in launches, sales conferences, training, incentives and summits to include celebrity attendees with one of the leading European event agencies, Nicola is just the type of high-level delegate you’ll find at our Luxe events.   </p>

    <br></br>
                    <h3>Incentives are on the rise </h3>   

    <br></br>     
                    <p>Attending Luxe was a no-brainer for Colligan, “We are seeing an increase in requests for luxury and incentives within our business and want to ensure that we have the best knowledge available to us in order to deliver to our clients.”  </p>

    <br></br>
                    <p>Since the pandemic statistics show that incentives are very much on the rise, something which Nicola confirms, “I feel I have seen it rise and become more of a priority for businesses.”  </p>
    <br></br>

                    <div className="pullquote"> <quote><span>"</span>I’m looking for: exciting local experiences, great food with a high-level service and a variety of options with room styles and destination venues.<span>"</span> </quote>

                    </div>

  <br></br>

                    <p>But clients looking for high-end incentives don’t want just want any incentive programme. Nicola tells us there has to be that special something: “’Something different’ is what I am often being informed of. The clients want that extra something that you may not expect and that’s unique. I’m looking for: exciting local experiences, great food with a high-level service and a variety of options with room styles and destination venues.”  </p>

    <br></br>

                    <img src={Boat} alt={" "} ></img><br/><br/>

    <br></br>

                  <h3>Luxe suppliers go the extra mile </h3>
    <br></br>

                  <p>And that’s where our suppliers come in. We spoke to Dobrica Milić, PR Manager for our host hotel and attending supplier, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ihg.com/regent/hotels/gb/en/porto-montenegro/tivpm/hoteldetail">Regent Porto Montenegro</a>, about what hotels need to prioritise if they want to break into the high-end incentive market.  </p>

  <br></br>

                  <p>“Focus on creating a unique blend of luxury and local allure. Offer versatile event spaces that capture breathtaking views and cater to specific needs. Craft personalised experiences and itineraries for VIP guests.” </p>

  <br></br>
                  <p>Again, we’re seeing a running theme in unique and different experiences; something with authenticity as opposed to something completely luxury focussed.  </p>
  
  <br></br>

                    <div className="pullquote"> <quote><span>"</span>Focus on creating a unique blend of luxury and local allure. Offer versatile event spaces that capture breathtaking views and cater to specific needs.<span>"</span> </quote>

                    </div>

  <br></br>

                  <p>Dobrica also stressed the importance of forging partnerships to provide “exclusive event venues and immersive activities” to enrich the client experience, and finally, to provide “exceptional service that reflects the essence of the location”. </p>

  <br></br>
                  <p>We already know that the Regent Porto Montenegro fits our high-end incentive criteria, or we wouldn’t have secured it as our meeting and accommodation venue, but what, in its own words, makes it an exquisite example? </p>

  <br></br>
                  <p>“Our hotel seamlessly blends Venetian-inspired architecture with a vibrant marina community” – Porto Montenegro, it’s worth noting, is home to the world’s largest super yacht marina. </p>

  <br></br>
                  <div className="pullquote"> <quote><span>"</span>The accessibility of nearby airports, combined with the allure of activities like yacht dinners, vineyard visits, and historic explorations, makes it a perfect high-end destination.<span>"</span> </quote>

                </div>

  <br></br>

                 <p>Dobrica continues: “With three accommodation wings, including the Venezia Wing's nautical-themed elegance and Aqua & Baia Wings' Riviera-inspired serenity, our luxurious rooms offer stunning views of Boka Bay and the Montenegrin mountains.” </p>

  <br></br>
                <p>And, of course, an exclusive MICE venue wouldn’t be complete without dedicated event space: “Our event spaces, including the grand Ballroom Teodo and scenic Summer Garden, cater to high-end corporate gatherings. Plus, VIP services, top-notch amenities, and customised itineraries to elevate the experience.” </p>

  <br></br>
                <h3>What makes a Luxe destination? </h3>

  <br></br>
                <p>So, now you’ve got a feel for the level of attendee at a Luxe Forum, it’s time we shone a light on Porto Montenegro itself. Dobrica sings the destination’s praises, its “blend of Montenegrin heritage” as well as its “stunning landscapes and Mediterranean allure”.  </p>

  <br></br>
                <p>Its impressive marina offers “a riviera lifestyle with fine dining, luxury boutiques, and breathtaking views” while the UNESCO-protected Boka Bay adds “a touch of exclusivity”. </p>

  <br></br>
                <p>Beyond its luxury facilities and features, it’s also conveniently located and full of exciting activities for small groups: “The accessibility of nearby airports, combined with the allure of activities like yacht dinners, vineyard visits, and historic explorations, makes it a perfect high-end destination.” </p>
            
<br></br>

<br></br>
                    <h3>Bringing the best in the business together </h3>
<br></br>

                    <p>With the launch of a brand-new event comes a little trepidation. While we’ve known for long time that a Forum of this type was needed for the industry and wanted by our audience, tapping into a new space in the industry always carries an element of risk.   </p>

                    <br></br>

                    <div className="pullquote"> <quote><span>"</span>I’ve been to 2 of your events previously! I’m very confident in m&i and your ability to bring suppliers and buyers together. I’ve made great connections through these events over the years!<span>"</span> </quote>

                </div>

                    <br></br>

                    <p>However, it’s clear that risk has paid off with the response to our new event being overwhelmingly positive. Our dedicated client base trust us because they’ve seen what we can do, as Nicola explains, “I’ve been to 2 of your events previously! I’m very confident in m&i and your ability to bring suppliers and buyers together. I’ve made great connections through these events over the years!”  </p>

                    <br></br>

                    <p>The Regent Porto Montenegro has already hosted a Private Luxury event for Worldwide Events event, commenting on its “exceptional” hosting experience and it’s excitement to host yet again:  </p>

                    <br></br>

                    <p>“We’re thrilled to host m&i Luxe, Porto Montenegro 2023. It's a privilege to bring together top-tier luxury MICE professionals in this stunning location. We look forward to showcasing our exceptional facilities and services, and to creating unforgettable experiences for all attendees.” </p>
