                                    <li>We recommend you pack a laptop or tablet in case any delegates are unexpectedly unable to attend their face-to-face meetings and virtual meetings are required.</li>
                                    <li>If you have a positive test result, feel unwell or have come into close contact with someone with COVID-19, please do not travel and inform our team as soon as possible.</li>
                                    <li>Remember to pack your face mask, it is mandatory to wear a mask on transport and enclosed public spaces. Although face coverings are not a legal requirement in the meeting room, wearing one can reduce the risk of infection for both yourself and others. We believe this is the best course of action to ensure a smooth-running event for all.</li>

                                    <li>If you feel unwell or show symptoms for COVID-19 during travel or at the airport, our team will direct you to the airport’s testing facilities. Following the test, you will be given a private transfer to the hotel, where you will be required to self-isolate until a negative test result is provided.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>In the event of a positive test result, we will follow instructions from the destination’s Health & Safety department. </li>

</li>
                                    <li>There will be a dedicated first aid and testing service available at the hotel. We advise you to contact your travel insurance company for any unforeseen costs.</li>
                                    <li>Should you be required to self-isolate, and feel well enough to carry out your meetings, our dedicated tech team will transfer your face-to-face meetings to a virtual format. Therefore we strongly recommend you bring your own laptop or tablet to use in this instance.

</li>
                                    <li>Should you be required to self-isolate due to close contact with someone who has tested positive, you can stop isolating on producing a negative Covid test result.
